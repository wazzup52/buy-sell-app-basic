# buy-sell-app-basic
This was my 1st project for POO2 class. It uses .txt files to save data and Swing for graphical interface.
There are 2 types of users: 
-buyer - which can buy products/change password/see all avaible products/ search for a specific product;
-seller - which can change password/see his own products/add new products;
